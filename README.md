projects i've done during learning about ml/dl 

red_white_classification: a simple classifier to determine if the quality of red or white wine is better than average based on eleven chemical metrics 

cifar10improved: exploring how batch normalization and data augmentation can be used to eke out nontrivial accuracy gains in cnns

optimizing_mnist_feedforward: wrote a random architecture generator and used it to explore hyperparameter selection and its effects on training time and accuracy

autoencoder-clustering: used an autoencoder to reduce nine-dimensional data consisting of health/economic metrics of countries. clustered this dimensionally reduced                         data using PCA and t-SNE to determine natural groupings by development stage
